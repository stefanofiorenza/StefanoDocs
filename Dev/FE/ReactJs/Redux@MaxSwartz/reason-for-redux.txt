Architecture:

	SPA:
	State on Server (Backend)
	State on Client.
	
	On Client: When data displayed are changing? Who else can change them?
	If they come from DB they need to be reloaded every time (some other user might update them in meanwhile)
	If they are local to user (ex. Quiz) nobody can change them for him, and they need to be mantained on client side (localStorage)

App Crud Products: (action on 1st product from list)
	Pages handle as state same data (array of products)
	
	Issues to solve:
	
	1) Pages:
		input fields onChange need state. 
		Updated values should reflect on common array.
		
	2) where to manage state? (props to state is anti pattern)
		props are supposed to be read only.
		They are used to pass data from parent to children components.
		Parent is only supposed to change children props through its own state.
	
	
	S1) Solution:
		Manage common data in a parent component.
		All pages will be children of parent component.
		Parent component 
		S1.1) keeps state, and pass it down to children through props.
		S1.2) change state through its own methods
		S1.3) pass the methods at (S1.2) to children as event handlers.
		
		Problem with solution (S1):
		Very difficult to manage application state in a bigger application with many pages, many object in the localState tree.
